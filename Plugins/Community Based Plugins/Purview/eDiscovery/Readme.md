# eDiscovery Plugin for Security Copilot
Author: Amit Singh

This custom Security Copilot plugin enhances your organization's eDiscovery capabilities in Microsoft Purview. It is designed for workflows where you create a case and export artifacts directly. You can initiate an export from Search after indexing and estimating the artifacts. However, this plugin does not support workflows that involve attaching searches to a review set for further analysis in eDiscovery. Attaching searches to a review set is a manual process that must be completed within the case in the Purview portal.

## Setting Up the Custom Plugin in Security Copilot

### Uploading the Custom Plugin  

1. **Download the Required File**  
   - Obtain the file **[`eDiscovery_OAuth_API_manifest.yaml`](https://github.com/samitks77/Copilot-For-Security/blob/main/Plugins/Community%20Based%20Plugins/Purview/eDiscovery/eDiscovery_OAuth_API_manifest.yaml)** from the designated directory. This YAML file will be uploaded to **Security Copilot** during the setup process.

3. **Generate and Copy Your Secret Value**
   - During the plugin upload process in **Security Copilot**, you will need a **Secret Value** from **Certificates & Secrets** in your Entra ID App.  
   - This **Secret Value** acts as your **API key** for the plugin to function correctly.  
   - **Important:** Copy your **Secret Value** immediately after creating it. If you navigate away from the page, the value will no longer be readable.
